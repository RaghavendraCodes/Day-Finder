# Day-Finder

This particular code helps us in finding the day of the week for a given date after the year 1600 in the Gregorian calendar.

* since, we know that the leap year day is added at the end of february, let us adopt the convenient fiction that each year 
ends at the end of february. 
* according to this plan, in the Gregorian year (Y) March and April are counted as the first and second months. january and 
february of the Gregorian year Y+1 are, for convenience, counted as the eleventh and twelfth months of the year Y
or previous year. 
* another convinience is to designate the days of the week, sunday through saturday, by the numbers 0,1,2,....,6.
* where,
  -> sunday    = 0
  -> monday    = 1
  -> tuesday   = 2
  -> wednesday = 3
  -> thursday  = 4
  -> friday    = 5
  -> saturday  = 6
